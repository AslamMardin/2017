<p style="color:red">primary content Once upon a time there was a little mouse living in Africa. Suddenly the mouse met a lion, and the little mouse ran away as far as he could because was so scared. The lion just loved to tease the mouse by acted like to chase the mouse. The lion was several days following the mouse, but was not able of catching him.
Some days later, the lion was captured by hunters and traped with the rope hanging in the tree trunk. The Lion began to roar non stop and try to make break loose or at least the hunters will let him go, but they did not.
The mouse who just across by accidently heard him, the mouse run went to where the lion was and a bit surprised by what he saw. The mouse so concerned for the situation and said:
“I will try to help you get you out of there, but first promise me that you won´t annoy me again, that you will be a nice lion“.
”Ok, Everything mouse I will do, I will leave you alone, but please, get me out of here” – said the lion.
